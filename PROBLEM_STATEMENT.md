# PROBLEM

## The Personal

* Assumes working with cursor - which doesn't yet have a way to define a 'global' rule repository
* When you work across many repos, there is no way to use the same rules without copy/pasting them to each project
* As you learn what works in Agentic Development you tweak your rules. But now the rules across repos are out of sync. To have the improvement in rules being used in Project A, you need to copy the rules back from Project B
* This becomes a chore (let alone unmanageable if you work in many projects)

## The Engineering Org

* As Orgs adopt this tool set, the problem multiplies. We want people to share their discoveries, what works best - especially wrt internal project, which may use particular coding conventions, or internal libraries.
* We need a central prompt/rules library where everyone in the org can benefit
* As we explore the space, developers will have different modes of working, and different tool preferences
* Rules at their heart are just specialized prompts for different scenarios. While we use cursor rule spec as the baseline, this tool can offer a install for Claude Code, or Roo - transforming the rule as necessary to whatever the prefered tool requires
* We need an easy way for our teams to keep up to date
