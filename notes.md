- Support Roo Code - they have a .roo folder, we should be able to export things like modes https://docs.roocode.com/features/custom-modes

Ok - so the thing with roo is, we can transform into "modes" https://docs.roocode.com/features/custom-modes#mode-specific-instructions-via-filesdirectories

by symln into the directory, and making a custom mode in .roomodes
not sure its worth it?
Or would it make more sense to do a tranform like that in CI alltogether?
